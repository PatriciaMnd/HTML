    <h1>Mirroring</h1>
    <p>Yes, something used by Andy Bernard on The Office is a legit psychological trick with science
        backing it up. Personality mirroring, or The Chameleon Effect, is when we unconsciously mimic
        the people around us—their postures, attitudes, and other behaviors. We all have a tendency to
        do this because of what’s known as the “perception-behavior link,” wherein observing a behavior
        increases the likelihood that we’ll repeat it.
        You can use this to your advantage by consciously mirroring people you’re trying to influence,
        matching their mannerisms and other behaviors. This increases trust and will make you seem more
        authoritative and trustworthy, because you’ll literally remind people of themselves.</p>

    <h1>Over-ask</h1>
    <p>Are you trying to get someone to do something? Try the Door in The Face (DITF) technique. You use
        this trick by first asking your target for something much harder or more outrageous than what you
        really want—something they’ll doubtlessly refuse. Then, back down and ask them for your original desire.
        The chances that they agree are now much higher because of DITF, which pivots off the Norm of Reciprocity
        discussed above (the name of this technique is taken from the concept of people slamming the door in a pushy
        salesperson’s face). When you downgrade what you’re asking, it’s perceived subconsciously as a concession—which
        creates a debt. People will have a strong urge to erase that debt by agreeing to your “lesser” request.</p>
